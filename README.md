The project consists of tutorials. The first part is the detail construction of quantum harmonic oscillator with contact interaction, which is the main model of the ultracold quantum gases.

The next part is developing. It will consist of extracting density profile, momentum distribution, and quantum information related quantities. Additionally, threebody interaction will be introduced since recently there is an proposal to realize only thereebody in experiments.
